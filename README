Phitly is a cheapo PHP wrapper for the Bitly API. Bitly's API is actually very straightforward, but we needed something portable and I wanted to test out PHP's "magic method" __call(), which is how PHP handles class method overloading. 

It was developed to be as portable and minimal as possible for media and advertising agencies that support multiple clients, applications, and users.

To initialize the Phitly class.

$_p = new Phitly;

To make an API call.

Phitly, which uses the aforementioned __call method, allows one to simply call any of the available endpoints by replacing a '/' with a '_' and using camelCase for any subsequent '_'.

So, if we wanted to call the realtime/bursting_phrases endpoint, we would do the following:

$_p = new Phitly;
// realtime/bursting_phrases becomes...
$foo = $_p->realtime_burstingPhrases();

Easy enough, right?
